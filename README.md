# Bober Stack ðŸ¦«
### LausHack 2024 - BOBST Challenge Project

## Overview
Bober Stack is a full-stack monitoring and control system developed for BOBST packaging company during LausHack 2024. The project name comes from "bober" (beaver) - our mascot representing BOBST's connection to paper and cardboard packaging.

The system provides real-time control and monitoring of a miniature Arduino-operated packaging conveyor belt through a Raspberry Pi interface.
